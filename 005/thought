merge_sort(input list):
    if the input list consists of more than one element:
        break up the input list into its left and right halves
        sort the left and right halves by recursively calling merge_sort
        merge the two sorted halves
        return the result
    otherwise, if the input list consists of only one element, then it is already sorted,
        and you can just return it.


helpers work fine
